  body: `As the curtain rises, I find myself once again in the familiar darkness of the theater. The scene before me, though vivid and full of color, feels distant, as if separated by an invisible barrier. It’s a sensation that many can relate to, but few have the words to describe. This is my life, viewed through the lens of a movie screen, a continuous narrative that seems both intimately familiar yet oddly detached.

From childhood, many of us are taught to “put on a brave face,” to be strong, and to hide our vulnerabilities. Over time, this act becomes so ingrained that our true selves, the raw, unfiltered version of us, gets buried beneath layers of rehearsed scenes and dialogues. We become spectators in our own lives, watching events unfold from a safe distance, shielded from the raw intensity of our emotions.

For years, I played the part assigned to me with dedication, adopting roles that were expected rather than chosen. I became the helper, the confidante, the listener — roles that allowed me to engage without truly being present. This cinematic distance became both my armor and my prison.

But every film, no matter how long, has an intermission.

It was during one of these pauses that I stumbled upon a question that would change everything: “Why?” Why had I chosen to watch life rather than live it? The answer was as complex as it was simple — fear. Fear of judgment, fear of rejection, fear of facing the traumas that lurked just beneath the surface. But with this realization came another: the power to change the narrative.

Shifting from a passive observer to an active participant in one’s own life is no small feat. It requires confronting the very fears that led to detachment in the first place. But in this challenge lies the opportunity for genuine connection, not only with others but with oneself.

As the lights in the theater begin to dim once more, I make a choice. Instead of settling back into my seat, I step forward, closer to the screen. The characters, the scenes, the emotions — they become more vivid, more real. I am no longer just watching; I am living, feeling, experiencing.

In this newfound proximity, I discover a truth that had long eluded me: Life is not meant to be viewed from a distance. It’s meant to be felt, embraced, and cherished up close. And so, as the final credits roll, I walk out of the theater and into the world, ready to play the most authentic role yet — myself.

I hope this resonates with your experiences and feelings.`,
